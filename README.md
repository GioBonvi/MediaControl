# MediaControl

Media control is an extremely simple (and bugged - beware!) custom control for JavaFX made by a MediaView and some controls in a bar.

## Functionalities

With this control is possible to play a video inside the JavaFX application, pause and resume it, control the volume and put it on fullscreen.

The bugged functionality is the progressbar: it's not interactive (read-only) and does not work while in fullscreen.
